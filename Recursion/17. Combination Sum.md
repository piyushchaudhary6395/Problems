Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return _a list of all **unique combinations** of_ `candidates` _where the chosen numbers sum to_ `target`_._ You may return the combinations in **any order**.

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the
frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
**Output:** [[2,2,3],[7]]
**Explanation:**
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
**Output:** [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** candidates = [2], target = 1
**Output:** []

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= candidates.length <= 30`
- `2 <= candidates[i] <= 40`
- All elements of `candidates` are **distinct**.
- `1 <= target <= 40`
```

So here we are again think in terms of selecting some elements and discarding others but here since the selected element can be selected multiple times, it is kept as it is, until it becomes greater than our `target`.  This is how we generate all possible combinations where each element can appear multiple times in combination with others.

If the `target` becomes zero we append the `current` vector which holds the elements that made it zero to the `ans` vector.

```cpp
void combo(vector<int> candidates, vector<vector<int>>& ans, vector<int> current, int target, int size, int i = 0) {
        if(i >= size) {
            if(target == 0)
                ans.emplace_back(current);
            return ;
        }

        if(target == 0) {
            ans.emplace_back(current);
            return ;
        }

        combo(candidates, ans, current, target, size, i+1);
        current.emplace_back(candidates[i]);
        if(target >= candidates[i])
            combo(candidates, ans, current, target-candidates[i], size, i);
    }

int main() {
	vector<int> candidates = {2, 3, 6, 7};
	int target = 7;
	vector<vector<int>> ans;
    vector<int> current;
    int size = candidates.size();

    combo(candidates, ans, current, target, size);

	for(auto i: ans) {
		for(auto j: i) {
			cout << j << " ";
		}
		cout << endl;
	}
}

==Time Complexity:== O(2^t * k)
If we were not allowed to pick an element multiple times then we had only two options pick and non-pick. Then the complexity would have been 2^n (exponential) and if we are assuming the average length of every combination generated is `k` so that is O(k) because we have to put the data structure in the base case to another data structure and this is not a constant operation. So it would be O(2^n * k).

The reason it is 2^t instead of 2^n is:
Assume that the target is 10 and you have element 1, so we would have to pick and not pick this guy 10 times. In total we can say it is 2^t, if there are n elements we can distribute on an average 2^t and k for same as above reason.

If the interviewer asks the time complexity then tell him exponential and if the asks what it is exactly then O(2^t * k)

==Space Complexity:== k * x (very hypothetical)
k is average length.
x means there are x combinations.

It is variable depending on the number of combinations we will have, if we ignore the auxiliary space recursion takes because we are not sure how many combinations we can have and all those things, that is very unpredictable. So we cannot predict the space complexity here, it will be completely dependent on the number of combinations.
