Consider a rat placed at **(0, 0)** in a square matrix of order **N * N**. It has to reach the destination at **(N - 1, N - 1)**. Find all possible paths that the rat can take to reach from source to destination. The directions in which the rat can move are **'U'(up)**, **'D'(down)**, **'L' (left)**, **'R' (right)**. Value 0 at a cell in the matrix represents that it is blocked and rat cannot move to it while value 1 at a cell in the matrix represents that rat can be travel through it.  
**Note**: In a path, no cell can be visited more than one time. If the source cell is 0, the rat cannot move to any other cell.

**Example 1:**

**Input**:
N = 4
m[][] = {{1, 0, 0, 0},
         {1, 1, 0, 1}, 
         {1, 1, 0, 0},
         {0, 1, 1, 1}}
**Output:**
DDRDRR DRDDRR
**Explanation**:
The rat can reach the destination at 
(3, 3) from (0, 0) by two paths - DRDDRR 
and DDRDRR, when printed in sorted order 
we get DDRDRR DRDDRR.

**Example 2:**

**Input**:
N = 2
m[][] = {{1, 0},
         {1, 0}}
**Output:**
[]
**Explanation**:
No path exists and destination cell is 
blocked.

**Your Task:**    
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function **printPath()** which takes **N** and 2D array **m[ ][ ]** as input parameters and returns the list of paths in lexicographically increasing order.   
**Note:** In case of no path, return an empty list. The driver will output **"-1"** automatically.

We created a  `visited` vector to keep track of which path we have taken, so we can avoid a infinite loop. We use `path` string to store the path. First we mark where we have visited then we can go in nay direction, let's say down. Before making the call to go down we check if that place is within bounds, we have not visited it before and that it is a opened path, if true then we add it to the path and go down, after that when we come back we need to remove the path from the `paht` string as well, so that new path can be made. When we reach our destination we insert the `path` to `ans` vector.
