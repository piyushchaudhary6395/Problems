## Problem statement
You are given an array 'a' of 'n' integers.

A majority element in the array ‘a’ is an element that appears more than 'n' / 2 times.

Find the majority element of the array.
It is guaranteed that the array 'a' always has a majority element.

**Example:**

Input: ‘n’ = 9, ‘a’ = [2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The frequency of ‘1’ is 5, which is greater than 9 / 2.
Hence ‘1’ is the majority element.

```

## Brute
O(n^2)

## Better

We are using map to count element frequency. key = element, value = frequency. Then we iterate over the map and find the frequency greater then n/2

```js
int find(vector<int> arr[], n) {
	map<int, int>mpp;
	for(int i = 0; i < arr.size(); n++) {
		mpp[v[i]]++;
	}
	
	for(auto item: mpp) {
		if(item->second > arr.size() / 2) return item->first; 
	}

	return -1;
}
```


## Optimal

We use **Moore's  voting algorithm** to solve this problem the approach of this algorithm is that we take two variables 

- counter=0
- element=0

first we check if the `arr[i] is == element` then we are going to counter++;

otherwise we are going to subtract 1 from the counter.

and check if the counter is zero if it's zero then we set the element to the `arr[i]`.

```js
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {7,7,5,7,1,7,5,5,7,7,5};
    int count = 0;
    int currentMax = 0;
    
    for(int i =0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if(count == 0) currentMax = arr[i];
        if(currentMax == arr[i]) count++;
        else count--;
        if(count > arr.size()/2) break;
    }

	int count2 = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if(arr[i] == currentMax) count2++;
    }

    if(count2 > arr.size() / 2) cout << currentMax;
    else cout << -1;
    return 0;
}
```
