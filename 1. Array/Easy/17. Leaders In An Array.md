```js
There is an integer array ‘a’ of size ‘n’.

An element is called a Superior Element if it is greater than all the elements present to its right.

You must return an array all Superior Elements in the array ‘a’.

Note:
The last element of the array is always a Superior Element. 

Example
Input: a = [1, 2, 3, 2], n = 4
Output: 2 3
```

# Brute
O(N^2). Take the `i` element in the first loop and then from `j = i + 1` iterate in the second nested loop and if there is an element such that `arr[j] > arr[i]` `i` is not a leader. If there is no element such that `arr[j] > arr[i]` `i` is a leader and push it.

# Optimal
Take a variable `maxi = INT_MIN`.  Iterate from the back and if the element is greater than the `maxi`, it is a leader and update `maxi` accordingly. If not then keep iterating.

```cpp
vector<int> superiorElemenEs(vector<int>&a) E
	vector<int> ans;
	int maxi = INT_MIN;|
	int n = a.size();
	
	for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
		if(a[i] > maxi) {
			ans.push_back(a[i]);
		}
		// keep track of right max
		maxi = max(maxi, a[il);
	}
	sort(ans.begin(), ans.end());
	return ans;
```
