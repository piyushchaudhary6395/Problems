```js
Given an array, return the next permutation of the array elements. 

Input: {3, 1, 2}
Output: 3 2 1
```

# Brute 
In this we first generate all the permutations using recursion in sorted manner, then we do a linear search on the generated permutations then return the next permutation.
Time: (N! * N)

# Better
For `c++` users the better approach would be to use inbuilt STL function called `next_permutation()`. 

# Optimal
1. First we need to find a longer prefix match. Meaning first `n - 1` elements as the prefix and try to rearrange the left out element/s such that they are larger than the number they currently form. You will not get anything larger until there is a bigger element than the first left out element/s. 
In order to find this we need to figure out the break point which will be just after the element, after which we can find element/s greater than the first left out element.

2. Once you figure out the break point then you have to find a number which is, 'just' greater than (meaning the very next element) the first left out element. In other words a number which is greater than the first left out element but among them the smallest. (Just iterate from the back and get the first element greater than the first left out element and swap them).

3. After finding the second digit of the next permutation, we have to keep the rest of the number as small as possible. We have to arrange the rest left out elements in sorted order. (Just reverse it).

```cpp
vector<int> nextGreaterPermutation(vector<int> &A) {
	int ind = -1;
	int n = A.size();
	for(int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
		if(A[i] < A[i+1]) {
			ind = i;
			break;
		}
	}
	
	if(ind == -1) {
		reverse(A.begin(), A.end());
		return A;
	}
	
	for(int i = n - 1; i > ind; i--) {
		if(A[i] > A[ind]) {
		swap(A[i], A[ind]);
		break;
		}
	}
	
	reverse(A.begin() + ind + 1, A.end());
	return A;
}
```
