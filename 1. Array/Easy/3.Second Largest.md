```js
Given an array **Arr** of size **N**, print second largest distinct element from an array.
**Example 1:**
**Input:** 
N = 6
Arr[] = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1}
**Output:** 34
**Explanation:** The largest element of the 
array is 35 and the second largest element
is 34.
```

```cpp
int getSecondLargest(int arr[], int n) {
	int largest = INT_MIN;
    int secondLargest = INT_MIN;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(arr[i] > largest) {
            secondLargest  = largest;
            largest = arr[i];
        }
        if(arr[i] > secondLargest && arr[i] < largest) {
            secondLargest = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return secondLargest;
}
```

here first we are creating two variables
- largest
- secondLargest

so the basic approach is that we will try to find the largest number and we know that if the current largest number is not the largest number then it must be second largest. so we assign it to the `secondLargest` when ever we have a new largest number.

but the array can be structured in such a manner that this approach will fail
```js
arr = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1};
```
so here first `largestElement` will become 35 then after that it won't be changed but this `secondLargest` is 34.

so for that reason we put another condition to handle this condition.
