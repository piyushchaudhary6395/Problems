```js
Given an array of 0, 1, 2's. Sort it.
Input: {1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2}
Output: {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2}
```

## Brute Force:-
Just sort is using the in built function.

## Better:-
Count the frequency of 0, 1, 2 and modify the same array by first inserting 0 then 1 then 2 with respect to their frequencies.

## Optimal:-
We use `Dutch National Flag Algorithm`. We have three pointers `low`, `mid`, `high`. `low` and `mid` point towards the front, while high points towards the end. We assume that from 0 to `low -1` array is sorted that is all 0's. Then we assume that from `low` to `mid - 1` array is sorted that is all 1's. The array from `mid` to `high` is not sorted. Then we assume that from `high + 1` to `n - 1` array is sorted that is all 2's.

Now we start iterating over the array till `mid <= high` because if `mid > high` then the array has been sorted (as shown above). If `arr[mid] == 0` then we swap `swap(arr[low], arr[mid])` and increment `low` and `mid`. If `arr[mid] == 1` then we just increment `mid`. If `arr[mid] == 2` then we swap `swap(arr[mid], arr[high])` and decrement high, we don't increment mid because in the `mid's` place there could be an non-sorted element which needs to get hit in one of the above conditions of 0 or 1 in the next iteration. 

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1};
    int size = arr.size();
    int low = 0;
    int mid = 0;
    int high = size - 1;

    while(mid <= high)
    {
        if(arr[mid] == 0)
        {
            swap(arr[low], arr[mid]);
            ++low;
            ++mid;
        }
        else if(arr[mid] == 1)
            ++mid;
        else
        {
            swap(arr[mid], arr[high]);
            --high;
        }
    }
    
    for(int i : arr)    cout << i << " ";
	    return 0;
}
```
