```js
Given an array with only one number appearing once and rest appearing twice.

Input: {1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 1}
Output: 2
```

## Brute Force:-
We can find the frequencies of each element using two nested for loops and save them in a map with frequency as the key and element as the value.  Then we know that ordered map is sorted by their keys in ascending order. Then we create an iterator on the first key, value pair and return it's value.

## Better:-
We can use a set to find unique elements then sum them up and multiply by 2. Then take the sum of array elements. Then subtract the sum of set's elements from array's element and we will have our answer.

## Optimal:- 
We make use of the fact that the other elements are appearing twice, so if we XOR them with one another they would become 0 and our target element would be left.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  vector<int> arr = {1,1,3,2,3,4,5,5,4};
  int xor1 = 0;

  for(auto i : arr {
    xor1 = xor1 ^ i;
  }
  cout << xor1;
}
```
