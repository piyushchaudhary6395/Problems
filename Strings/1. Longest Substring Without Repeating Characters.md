```js
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

We use hash map and sliding window. If the character is not in the map then we push it along with its index. If it is in the map then we first calculate what is the size of the substring up to this point. Then we update `i` one step forward to the occurence of the repeated character and check if `i` is greater than one step forward of the occurence of the repeated character, if it is then we don't update it because , that would be making `i` go backward which will result in wrong calculation of the `longestString`. Then we update `j` and set the index of the repeated character to it's latest appearance so that `i` can be moved forward correctly.
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 1;
        int longestString = 1;
        int size = s.length();
        unordered_map<char, int> myMap;
        myMap.insert({s[0], 0});

        if (s == "")
            return 0;

        while (j < size) {
            if (myMap.find(s[j]) == myMap.end()) {
                myMap.insert({s[j], j});
            } else {
                longestString = max(longestString, j - i);
                i = max(myMap[s[j]] + 1, i);
                myMap[s[j]] = j;
            }
            j++;
        }
        longestString = max(longestString, j - i);
        return longestString;
    }
};
```
